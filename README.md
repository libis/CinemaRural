This Github repository contains alle technical documentation about the CollectiveAccess cataloguing tool behind the [Cinema Rural Film Database](https://cagnet.be/page/cinema-rural-filmdatabank ). 

## About

Cinema Rural is a project of the Center for Agricultural History (CAG) in Leuven (Belgium), which is part of a broader international initiative led by the European Rural History Film Association.
The project aims to record agricultural film heritage, to safeguard it and make it findable and accessible for researchers and the public. CAG wants to trace as much film heritage as possible with the theme of agriculture and rural life in Belgium and make it accessible, first through the [Cinema Rural Film Database](https://cagnet.be/page/cinema-rural-filmdatabank ), then through the database of the [European Rural History Film Association](https://ruralfilms.eu).

The repository contains the Collective Access Installation Profile for the cataloguing tool that feeds the Cinema Rural Film Database, including import and export scripts, and all information about the OAI-PMH endpoint that enables re-use of metadata from the Cinema Rural Film Database in other catalogues.

## Collective Access Installation Profile
The Cinema Rural Film Database currently uses [Collective Access 1.7.6](https://collectiveaccess.org/) (CA) as a cataloguig tool. CA uses a cataloguing profile that was developed specifically for this database: [cinema_rural.xml](https://github.com/libis/CinemaRural/blob/master/cinema_rural.xml). 
Instructions for installing a CA with an external profile are available on the [CA Wiki](https://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Installation_profile).
